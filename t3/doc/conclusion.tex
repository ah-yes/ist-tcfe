\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The theoretical and experimental results had a clear difference, in most part caused by the assumption of an ideal diode. Still, with a very simple circuit, it was possible to attain very pleasent results, having very little ripple with a merit figure of $M = 0.570$. Even though it was still possible to get even more precision, by increasing the resistence, getting more diodes was cheaper, with somewhat similar results.
