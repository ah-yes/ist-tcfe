In this assignment, we present and analyse a possible design of an AC/DC voltage converter, with a desired output voltage of 12V and an input of a sinusodal signal with an amplitude of 220V and a frequency of 50Hz. Thus, we used an envelope circuit composed of an ideal  transformer and full wave bridge rectifier in series with a parallel association of a capacitor and a resistor, followed by a voltage regulator encompassing 13 diodes and another resistor. The output voltage was mesured at the terminals of the diode association.
Furthermore, a cost/effectiveness analysis was also done, with set prices for the diodes (0.1 monetary unit per diode), resistors (1 monetary unit per kOhm) and capacitors(1 monetary unit per micro-Farad).

We set $R_{\beta} = 10 k\omega$ \, $R_{\phi} = 19 k\omega$ $C = 10\mu F$\, and $n = 2766.4$ together withe 17 diodes fulfilling a total cost of 40.7 MU.

We then began by analysing the circuit by means of simulation with \textit{ngspice} and a theoretical approach using \textit{Octave}. Afterwards the results from both methods were compared followed by a discussion of the efficacy of the AC/DC transformer.
