\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

All in all, despite some divergence the linear approximation to the BJT's transistor in the F.A.R. proved useful in some extente to understant the behaviour of the circuit. 
The audio amplifier while showing some problems when opperating at the lower frequencies of the audible spectrum, works well for frequencies higher than 100Hz, with a bandwith of approximatly 10MHz and a gain of almost 40dB. An ouput impedence of less than 7.5 $\Omega$ is very adequate to connect to the $8 \Omega$ speaker. With this we obtained a merit figure of $2.1 \times 10^7$.
