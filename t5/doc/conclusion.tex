\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

All in all, the proposed circuit works well as an active bandpass filter with a central frequency and central frequency gain with minor deviation from the ones requested. As mentioned before, the high ouput impedence, for smaller frequencies, may become problematic and an additional output circuit may eventually be required to reach a smaller output impedence, to avoit voltage loss. Lastly, the results from the theoretical analysis and the simulation are very similar, with divergence for the gain above 0.1MHz and input impedance diminuishing heavily at high frequencies. Nontheless, for frequencies bellow 0.1MHz, the ideal model for the OP-AMP is very fitting to describe the circuit
